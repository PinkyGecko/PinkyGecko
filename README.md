<p align="center">I keen on 3d design for games/media, mainly 3d character design pipeline, but also love to practice hard-surface, props design and animation. Looking forward to be included in any interesting projects:)</p>

-   ðŸŽ“ I'm self-taught artist. Been practicing using open sources and some courses. During learning I noticed that my head concume information pretty fast!
-   ðŸ’¡ I practice such software as: Blender, Zbrush, Substance Painter and Character creator. Using this programs I practice such parts of pipeline as: skulpting, modeling/retopology, texturing, rigging and animation. All my works you can see in my <a href="https://chihante34.artstation.com">ArtStation<a>.
-   ðŸ”¥ During practicing 3D design I didn't stop making traditional art, mostly using ink and watercolors. This helps me to make my own references/concepts and seek for unique visual style.
